========================================================================
Analytical Solutions for the Richards Equation in 2D and 3D Domains
------------------------------------------------------------------------

gwassess is a python package that implements analytical and reference solutions
to the Richards equation in 2D and 3D domains. The package provides benchmark
solutions for testing numerical solvers of unsaturated flow in porous media.

Installation
============

gwassess is a standard python package that can be installed from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd gwassess
    pip install .

Or install directly from the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/g-adopt/gwassess.git

Usage
=====

Basic usage example for the Tracy 2D analytical solution:

.. code-block:: python

    import gwassess
    import numpy as np

    # Initialize Tracy solution with soil and domain parameters
    solution = gwassess.TracyRichardsSolution2D(
        alpha=0.328,      # Exponential soil parameter [1/m]
        hr=-15.24,        # Reference pressure head [m]
        L=15.24,          # Domain size [m]
        theta_r=0.15,     # Residual water content [-]
        theta_s=0.45,     # Saturated water content [-]
        Ks=1.0e-05        # Saturated hydraulic conductivity [m/s]
    )

    # Evaluate pressure head at a point
    x, y, t = 7.62, 7.62, 1000.0
    h = solution.pressure_head_specified_head(x, y, t)
    print(f"Pressure head at ({x}, {y}) at time {t}: {h:.6f} m")

    # Or use Cartesian coordinates
    X = [7.62, 7.62]
    h = solution.pressure_head_cartesian(X, t, bc_type='specified_head')
